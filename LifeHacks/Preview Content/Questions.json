Or you can disable that feature and just let your cat lounge on your keyboard as much as she likes, secure in the knowledge that it won't harm your computer (except maybe by getting the fans full of cat hair, but that'll happen anyway).</p>\n\n<p>The one I've personally used, and can testify to the effectiveness of, is <a href=\"http://www.bitboost.com/pawsense/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">PawSense</a>, which the screenshot above comes from.  Alas, it's Windows-only, and somewhat pricey too, but my parents own a license and have been quite satisfied with it. <a href=\"http://priceonomics.com/the-software-that-detects-when-a-cat-is-messing/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"> And it's even won an IgNobel prize!</a> ;-)</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, there's a program called <a href=\"https://people.math.osu.edu/fowler.291/software/cat-nip/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">CatNip</a> that does the same for OS X.  Alas, I'm not yet aware of equivalent software for Linux.  Apparently, in this particular respect, open source <em>is</em> (so far) inferior! ;-)</p>\n\n<p>Ps.

The way I look at it is this: stained clothes I can spot wash and if the clothes are smelly in the first place I definitely don't want to wear them again until they're washed. So I spot wash anything with a stain and at this point I can't tell the difference from clean clothes, so I exploit this so the clothes can actually be put back with the clean clothes in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Wrinkles are a problem, and since an iron is too much work another great life hack is to use a hand-steamer, which is easy to store and operate and works just as well. Again at this point the clothes have reached a state where they able to go into the wardrobe without any confusion or unsightliness.</p>\n\n<p>I've found this system is a really huge improvement on the state of my room and my wardrobe because it's a backdoor approach to avoiding having another category of storage that I had difficulty getting to really work out right. Plus I always have more good clothes to wear and I have to do laundry less because I've found the trick to keeping clothes ready-to-wear clean and wrinkle-free.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>\n"

If you've been dating seriously for awhile, you'd be surprised how often this type of thing comes up. If neither of them know her ring size, they will likely be more than happy to get in on the intrigue. They can (more easily than you) find out her size under the guise of buying a gift or some other type of conversational pretense like <em>&quot;damn, you really need to know such things just in case, y'know?&quot;</em> Of course, all oaths of secrecy apply.</p>\n<h3>The Solo Scenario</h3>\n<p>If you decide to go with this on your own — when you are buying a ring from a jeweler, you typically buy the ring in their &quot;standard&quot; size; I believe it is usually a size 7. Display case rings are typically made a bit larger by design because they want a prospective buyer to be able to see it on their finger; that plus it is typically less destructive to resize the ring smaller than to try and make it bigger later.</p>\n<p>Ask the jeweler about the design of the ring and if knowing the ring size is more or less important than sizing it later. If the shank is plain (the part that wraps around the bottom), re-sizing is easy. If it's too big, they simply slice out a small portion at the bottom and join the ends seamlessly. If it's too small, the metal can be heated and stretched, but the thickness of the band will determine how much they can size it before more material has to be added. Adding material can leave a slight line between the old and new metal, so it is better get the bigger ring.</p>\n<p>If the ring shank is more ornamental (encrusted with diamonds or something), the ring size is sometimes best known <em>before</em> the ring is even made. That may be a factor in your decision about which ring to purchase. Ask the jeweler.</p>\n"
